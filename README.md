# MoodDecode
An NLP-powered FastAPI endpoint that decodes human emotion, flags potential crisis signals, and generates concise summaries, all from raw text.
# MoodDecoding NLP API

## Overview

The **MoodDecoding NLP API** is a FastAPI-based application that leverages pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze emotional tone, detect psychological crises, and generate coherent textual summaries. It is designed to be integrated into systems where affective understanding and summarization of text data are crucial, such as in mental health tools, conversational agents, research pipelines, and human-computer interaction platforms.

This API combines efficient transformer models from Hugging Face to deliver high-performance inference for emotion classification, crisis detection, and abstractive summarization.

## Features

- **Emotion Classification**  
  Predicts the dominant emotion from user input text using a lightweight DistilBERT variant fine-tuned on emotion datasets.

- **Crisis Detection**  
  Identifies high-risk emotional expressions (e.g., sadness, fear, anger) with confidence thresholds for better reliability in safety-sensitive contexts.

- **Text Summarization**  
  Condenses verbose or detailed input into short, informative summaries using a BART-based model.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /analyze_mood`

**Description:**  
Predicts the most likely emotion from the given input text.

**Purpose:** Predict the primary emotion expressed in the input text.

**Logic:**  
Applies emotion classification using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model and returns the top-ranked label.


**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "text": "I feel amazing today!"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "emotion": "joy"
}
```

---

### `POST /detect_crisis`

**Description:**  
Determines whether the text contains crisis-related emotional indicators such as sadness, fear, or anger.

**Purpose:** Detect potential crisis signals in the input.

**Logic:**
Runs emotion classification, then checks if the predicted label is among predefined crisis-associated emotions and if the confidence score is high (> 0.85).

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "text": "I'm feeling hopeless and might hurt myself"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "crisis_detected": true
}
```

---

### `POST /summarize`

**Description:**  
Generates a summarized version of the provided text input.

**Purpose:** Generate a condensed summary of the input text.

**Logic:**
Uses a pre-trained BART summarization model with maximum and minimum length constraints to ensure clarity and brevity.
**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "text": "Long paragraph here..."
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "summary": "Condensed version of input..."
}
```
